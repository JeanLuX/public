# Samsung Galaxy Book6 Ultra (NP960UJG-KG2FR) on Linux

## System

- Model: Samsung Galaxy Book6 Ultra (NP960UJG-KG2FR | PVAL)
- CPU: Intel Core Ultra X7 358H
- iGPU: Intel Arc B390
- RAM: 32 GB
- Storage: 1 TB NVMe SSD
- Operating system: Aurora 44 (based on Fedora 44 Kinoite)
- Kernel: 7.1.5-200.fc44.x86_64 (64-bit)
- Graphics platform: Wayland

## Display

### Internal OLED panel

- Resolution: 2880x1800
- Refresh rates: 60 Hz and 120 Hz
- HDR and wide-gamut support are present in the panel, but KDE Plasma currently reports both as unavailable.
- The panel EDID advertises DisplayID 2.0 with an encapsulated CTA-861 block containing BT.2020 RGB and SMPTE ST 2084/PQ metadata, with approximately 1100 nits peak brightness.
- Installed `libdisplay-info 0.3.0` does not search CTA blocks nested in DisplayID 2.0. KWin therefore receives neither HDR nor wide-gamut capability.
- The upstream parser fix is included from `libdisplay-info 0.4.0`; Aurora/Fedora 44 still provides `0.3.0` and needs an update or backport.
- Local status: `kscreen-doctor` reports `HDR: incapable` and `Wide Color Gamut: incapable` for `eDP-1`.
- Workaround: add `KWIN_FORCE_ASSUME_HDR_SUPPORT=1` to `/etc/environment` to expose the HDR option in KDE Display Configuration.
  - HDR content displays correctly, but SDR content is dimmer than expected.

### Adaptive Sync and Panel Replay

- If Adaptive Sync is enabled, use kernel parameter `xe.enable_panel_replay=0`.
- Without it, the internal screen may show artifacts, become unusable intermittently, or trigger a full system crash under internal display load.
- Enabling this parameter seems to slightly reduce battery life.
- If battery life is the priority, disabling Adaptive Sync entirely may be preferable. Occasional artifacts can still occur, especially after multiple sleep/wake cycles with Electron applications.
- Forcing active sync mode instead of automatic mode feels sluggish, with persistent low-FPS behavior and a less responsive cursor/touchpad.

## Audio

- Without required Cirrus Logic firmware, audio works only in minimal/fallback mode.
- Firmware can be extracted from Samsung's official Windows driver and installed on Linux. This significantly improves audio quality, bringing it close to the Windows experience without Dolby processing or other artificial enhancements.
- Result is sufficient for everyday use and restores built-in speakers' intended character and capability.
- Extraction procedure: [AUDIO-CIRRUS-FIRMWARE-EXTRACTION.md](./AUDIO-CIRRUS-FIRMWARE-EXTRACTION.md)

## Storage

- LUKS encryption limits NVMe throughput to about 4 GB/s instead of approximately 7 GB/s unencrypted. Daily usage is generally not noticeably affected.
- SSD appears to support OPAL. Correct configuration could offload encryption to the SSD controller and provide near-native performance.
- On Windows 11, performance appears to remain near maximum with BitLocker enabled.

## Sensors and Input

### Ambient light sensor

- KDE does not currently detect the ambient light sensor, so automatic brightness adjustment is unavailable.
- It can work after installing Samsung-specific Panther Lake ISH firmware.
- Generic `ish_ptl.bin` is rejected with `ISH loader: cmd 2 failed 10`; no ISH HID/IIO sensor is enumerated without the Samsung-specific firmware.
- Extraction and installation procedure: [AMBIENT-LIGHT-SENSOR-FIRMWARE-EXTRACTION.md](./AMBIENT-LIGHT-SENSOR-FIRMWARE-EXTRACTION.md)
- Procedure covers Ubuntu, Fedora non-Atomic, and Fedora Atomic systems.
- With firmware installed, `kscreen-doctor` reports `Automatic brightness: supported, enabled`.

### Fingerprint reader

- Does not work, with no visible KDE integration.
- Can be made to work by patching fprintd, for example: https://github.com/TenSeventy7/libfprint-egismoc-sdcp/issues/9

### Touchpad and keyboard shortcuts

- Fn shortcuts not working:
  - Fn+F1: Settings
  - Fn+F10: Microphone mute toggle
  - Fn+F11: Camera toggle
- `dmesg` shows unknown ACPI notification events.
- Related issue: https://github.com/joshuagrisham/samsung-galaxybook-extras/issues/108

## Camera

- Webcam is not recognized yet.
- A project has managed to make it work, so an additional device ID declaration in the kernel or driver may be sufficient.
- Related issue: https://github.com/intel/ipu7-drivers/issues/73#issuecomment-4881775585

## Thermal Management

- `quiet` platform profile is missing.
- Available profiles through `/sys/firmware/acpi/platform_profile_choices`:

```text
# cat /sys/firmware/acpi/platform_profile_choices
low-power balanced performance
```

- `low-power` corresponds to Silent, `balanced` to Optimized, and `performance` to High performance.
- Fans activate rarely or very late outside `performance`, causing significant heat buildup during heavy workloads across the chassis.
- Windows 11 activates fans more frequently under the same usage conditions.

## Power Management

- Battery life is good and likely comparable to Windows 11 in practical use; no strict side-by-side benchmark performed.
- More than 12 hours is achievable for software development workloads at 20% brightness using Tuned Power Save.
- A lighter, more optimized IDE than Visual Studio Code may exceed 15 hours under similar conditions.
- Sleep mode (`s2idle`) has relatively low drain, approximately 0.38% per hour, though it remains less efficient than a MacBook.

## Overall Status

- Most hardware works correctly overall.
